# StackOne - Ultimate Developer Workspace

StackOne is a unified developer workspace and team dashboard that aggregates core engineering utilities into a single integrated tab. By combining project tracking, code analytics, expense ledgering, portfolios, and quizzes, it serves as a central hub for individual developer workflows.

## JS Quiz Engine

A timed, interactive JavaScript quiz built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Test your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals with 10 carefully curated questions.

### Features

- **10 Multiple-Choice Questions** — Covers topics like type coercion, scope, arrays, promises, and more.
- **30-Second Timer** — Each question has a countdown timer. If time runs out, the answer is marked incorrect.
- **Instant Feedback** — Correct and incorrect answers are highlighted with visual icons and color coding.
- **Explanations** — After answering, a detailed explanation is shown for every question.
- **Progress Bar** — A visual progress bar tracks your position through the quiz.
- **Score Summary** — At the end, a summary card shows your percentage score with a personalized verdict.
- **Play Again** — Restart the quiz anytime to improve your score.

## Team Portfolios

A directory of engineering team profiles showcasing their roles, specific skill tags, and social profiles.

### Features

- **Dynamic Avatars** — Programmatically extracts letters from team member names to create initial-based profile avatars.
- **Color Coding** — Alternating profile color themes for each member card.
- **Contact Forms** — Built-in message board form with input validation (checks empty names, valid email formats, and minimum message length rules) to ensure messages are delivered successfully.

## Expense Tracker

A ledger system that computes finances, classifies transactions, and monitors business expenses in real-time.

### Features

- **Summary Cards** — Dynamically calculates your Net Balance, Total Income, and Total Expenses using vanilla looping structures.
- **Ledger Logger** — Shows individual entries with custom indicators (green rising charts for incomes, red falling charts for expenses) along with descriptions, dates, and amounts.
- **Categorical Filtering** — Tabs to filter the ledger logs by transaction categories ("All", "Income", "Expenses").
- **Persistence & Zero State** - Integrates with browser LocalStorage to save your data permanently, starting from $0.00 on clean load.

## GitHub Explorer

An integration interface that communicates with the official GitHub REST API to perform lookup operations on developers' public profiles and codebases.

### Features

- **Live Profile Search** — Fetch profile avatars, names, usernames, follower counts, following counts, repositories, bios, and locations.
- **Language Charts** — Computes repository languages and displays a visual bar graph detailing the percentage layout of code languages.
- **Star & Fork Sorter** — List public repositories and sort them dynamically by their popularity (stars) or fork counts.
- **Offline Fallback** — Programmed with local cached files to display mock search profiles (such as Google or Octocat) in case GitHub API limits are exceeded.

## Kanban Task Board

A workflow management dashboard designed to organize tasks, adjust sprints, and track progress using category boards.

### Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Categories** — Move cards between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns smoothly. Highlight borders alert target drop zones during drags.
- **Card Creator Modal** — Launch a dedicated modal window to create or edit cards, configure custom fields (Title, Description), and choose priority levels.
- **Priority Indicators** — Color-coded left borders and tags (green for Low, orange for Medium, red for High) allow fast visually-scanned boards.
- **Dynamic Task Counts** — Automatically updates the task number counters on each column header upon creation, edit, movement, or deletion.

### Tech Stack

### Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic, clean page layout structures
- **CSS3** — Responsive layouts, customizable variables, glassmorphic popups, animations, and dark/light themes
- **JavaScript** — Plain vanilla JS, dynamic API requests, LocalStorage syncing, and custom drag-and-drop systems
